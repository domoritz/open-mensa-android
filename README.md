**Looking for new maintainers:** I don't have time to maintain this app anymore. Please [get in touch with me](https://www.domoritz.de/) if you are interested in taking over development of new features and making releases.

## Developer

Import the project as a gradle project in Android Studio and start hacking. Join the development in #openmensa on [freenode.net](http://freenode.net/).

Make sure you installed the `Android Support Repository` from the SDK Manager.

Create a release with `./gradlew --no-daemon assembleRelease`.
