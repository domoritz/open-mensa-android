# Privacy Policy

This document describes the data processing of the Android application OpenMensa.

Last update: 2022-01-27

## OpenMensa API

This application requests data from the server that you chose. By default,
this is ``https://openmensa.org/api/``.

The server does receive two kinds of requests:

- requests for the canteen list
- requests for the meals of a specific canteen

The requests for the meals show the server operator which canteen you chose.

## Open Street Map

When enabling the map, then requests to tile.openstreetmap.org will be sent.
For this, the privacy policy of the OpenStreetMap Foundation at
<https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy> applies.

## Location access

You have the option to grant OpenMensa the access to your location. This is
processed at your device only to sort and filter the canteen list.

## Canteen history

The last chosen canteens and cities are saved at your device to sort
and filter the city and canteen list.
